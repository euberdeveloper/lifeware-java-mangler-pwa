# Mangle Constructor

## Description

The mangle constructor is used to mangle the name of a Java constructor into the corrisponding signature and constructor definition in Smalltalk.

## Usage

* There is an input in which it is possible to type the constructor to mangle. 
* Reactively, the mangled signature and the constructor definition are shown, as soon as the input has a valid value.
* If the input does not have a valid value, the border becomes red and the mangled signature and the constructor definition are not shown or show the last valid value.
* It is possible to copy the mangled signature and the constructor definition by clicking on the copy button.
* When changing between pages, the input is not cleared and coming back to the page, the last value is shown.
